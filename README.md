"Web LIsp Front EnD" is A Slime client in JS for the browser. Its name is an echo of "Fred" the Emacs subset in Macintosh Common Lisp.

Will talk to Swank running in a Common Lisp.

Code editing will initially be in CodeMirror, but once it works, I will likely replace that with a subset of Emacs.

Will write it in [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/), if that builds fast enough, or [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) otherwise.

See [ClojureScript.md](ClojureScript.md) for instructions on installing a learning Clojure and ClojureScript.
