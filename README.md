"Web LIsp Front EnD" is A Slime client in JS for the browser. Its name is an echo of "Fred" the Emacs subset in Macintosh Common Lisp.

Will talk to Swank running in a Common Lisp.

Code editing will initially be in CodeMirror, but once it works, I will likely replace that with a subset of Emacs.

Will write it in ClojureScript, if that builds fast enough, or Elm otherwise.
