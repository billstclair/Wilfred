My notes on learning ClojureScript.

* Java Development Kit (JDK): https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html
* Getting started with Clojure: https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started
* Project manager: https://leiningen.org/

From "lein help tutorial":

"Leiningen is for automating Clojure projects without setting your hair
on fire. If you experience your hair catching on fire or any other
frustrations while following this tutorial, please
[let us know](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues/new)."

ClojureScript HOWTO: https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start

<a href='https://www.toptal.com/clojure/clojurescript-tutorial-react-front-end'>Unearthing ClojureScript for Front-end Development</a> by Luke Tomlin. A dead-simple introduction to ClojureScript. Uses [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) via [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent), with Leiningen for project management and auto-builds. Example code is at [github.com/tetigi/unearthing-clojurescript](https://github.com/tetigi/unearthing-clojurescript). Part 2, [Top Level Control with Redux State Management: A ClojureScript Tutorial](https://www.toptal.com/clojure/redux-state-management-clojurescript-howto), covers state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) via [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame), which is documented at [day8.github.io/re-frame/](https://day8.github.io/re-frame/re-frame/).

[Clojars.org](https://clojars.org/) "is a dead easy community repository for open source Clojure libraries."
